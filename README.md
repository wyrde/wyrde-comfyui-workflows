## Custom Nodes and Extensions

The custom nodes and extensions I know about.

* Developers with githtub accounts can easily add to the list

### CivitAI

* Many custom nodes are provided as packages on [civitai](https://civitai.com/).
* Use the "other" type in filters or search with the [comfyui](https://civitai.com/?query=comfyui) tag.

## Useful things

* [Upscale Database](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database)
    * note: stick to the universals unless there's one that fits specific needs
    * I often use 2xPNSR for quick upscales (first line, in source section).
    * lollypop x4 is my favorite for illustration style images.
* [Upscales at HF](https://huggingface.co/wyrde/upscales) is an archive of some upscalers on huggingface.
* [A handy chart of aspect ratios](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9657443/231819299-77de2080-7b04-4512-9922-56faec2596b8.png) from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/10wqv7r/when_it_comes_to_printing_converting_resolutions/)

## inject SD into the brain

* [OlivioSarikas videos](https://www.youtube.com/@OlivioSarikas)
* [about safetensors](https://rentry.org/safetensorsguide)
* [about vae](https://rentry.org/sdvae)
* List of [nodes and examples of use](https://comfyui.creamlab.net/nodes) (Japanese)

## More SD resources

* [civitai](https://civitai.com/) is probably the most popular model site
* [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) is the most professional model site (a git-style repository)

## Useful Things

* [XNView](https://www.xnview.com/en/) a great, light-weight and impressively capable file viewer. It shows the workflow stored in the exif data (View→Panels→Information). Also has favorite folders to make moving and sortintg images from `./output` easier. There may be something better out there for this, but I've not found it.
* [Powertoys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) make windows experience more pleasant. Especially [windows terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/)
* [process explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) get a better look at what is going on. Add the "GPU Dedicated Bytes" column and see what is eating away VRAM
